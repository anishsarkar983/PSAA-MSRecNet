The PSAA-MSRecNet is a deep learning-based hyperspectral band selection model that uses position-sensitive axial attention to capture global spectral–spatial dependencies and a multi-scale reconstruction network to extract features at different resolutions. Tested on Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas datasets, it consistently selects more informative bands and achieves superior classification accuracy over existing attention-based BS methods.
